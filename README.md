# CS4532-Concurrent-Programming-Lab2
This problem was originally based on the Senate bus at Wellesley College. Riders come to a bus  stop and wait for a bus. When the bus arrives, all the waiting riders invoke boardBus, but anyone who  arrives while the bus is boarding has to wait for the next bus. The capacity of the bus is 50 people.
